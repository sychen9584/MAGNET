  abstract: 'We assessed tissue macrophage gene expression in different mouse organs. Diversity in gene expression among different populations of macrophages was remarkable. Only a few hundred mRNA transcripts stood out as selectively expressed by macrophages over DCs and many of these were not present in all macrophages. Nonetheless, well-characterized surface markers, including MerTK and FcγR1 (CD64), along with a cluster of novel transcripts were distinctly and universally associated with mature tissue macrophages. TCEF3, C/EBPα, BACH1, and CREG-1 were among the top transcriptional regulators predicted to regulate these core macrophage-associated genes. 
  Other transcription factor mRNAs were strongly associated with single macrophage populations. We further 
  illustrate how these transcripts and the proteins they encode facilitate distinguishing 
  macrophage versus DC identity of less characterized populations of mononuclear phagocytes.'

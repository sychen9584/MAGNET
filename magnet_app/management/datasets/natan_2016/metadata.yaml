  abstract: 'Microglia, the resident myeloid cells of the central nervous system, play important roles 
  in life-long brain maintenance and in pathology. Despite their importance, their regulatory dynamics 
  during brain development have not been fully elucidated. Using genome-wide chromatin and expression profiling 
  coupled with single-cell transcriptomic analysis throughout development, we found that microglia undergo three 
  temporal stages of development in synchrony with the brain--early, pre-, and adult microglia--which are 
  under distinct regulatory circuits. Knockout of the gene encoding the adult microglia transcription 
  factor MAFB and environmental perturbations, such as those affecting the microbiome or prenatal immune 
  activation, led to disruption of developmental genes and immune response pathways. Together, our work 
  identifies a stepwise microglia developmental program integrating immune response pathways that may be 
  associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders.'

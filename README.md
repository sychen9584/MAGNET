#### Macrophage Annotation of Gene Network Enrichment Tool

Characterization of gene lists obtained from high-throughput genomic experiments is an essential task
to uncover the underlying biological insights. A common strategy is to perform enrichment analyses
that utilize standardized biological annotations, such as GO and KEGG pathways, which attempt to
encompass all domains of biology. However, this approach provides generalized, static results that
may fail to capture subtleties associated with research questions within a specific domain. Thus, there
is a need for an application that can provide precise, relevant results by leveraging the latest research.
We have therefore developed an interactive web application, Macrophage Annotation of Gene Network
Enrichment Tool or MAGNET, for performing enrichment analyses on gene sets that are specifically
relevant to macrophages. Using the hypergeometric distribution, MAGNET assesses the significance
of overlapping genes with annotations from recent macrophage studies, that were curated from
published manuscripts and data repositories. We implemented numerous features that enhance utility
and user-friendliness, such as the simultaneous testing of multiple gene sets, different visualization
options, option to upload custom datasets, and downloadable outputs. Here, we use two example
studies compared against our current database of seven publications on mouse macrophages to
demonstrate that MAGNET provides relevant and unique results that complement well with
conventional enrichment analysis tools. Although specific to macrophage datasets, we envision
MAGNET will catalyze developments of similar applications in other domains of interest.
